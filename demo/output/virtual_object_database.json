The interaction is likely to be a momentary tap to test if the chest can be opened, followed by a sustained push to lift the lid. The wooden texture will provide a tactile feedback, and the lid will respond by swinging open, simulating the weight of a real chest. Users may also use their palms or fingers to feel the surface before opening."

The center of mass concentrated at one end will provide a realistic inertia, making it feel heavy when lifted. Users may also perform a downward striking motion, simulating the action of using a hammer in real life."

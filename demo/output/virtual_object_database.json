The interaction will likely involve a pressing motion to push down on the lid, followed by a pulling motion to lift it open. The chest's wooden texture will provide a tactile feedback, and users may feel a slight resistance when lifting the lid due to its weight. The interaction is expected to be momentary as users quickly open the chest to access its contents."

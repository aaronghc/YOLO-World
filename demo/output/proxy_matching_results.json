The interaction will involve a punching motion, where users will strike the bag with their fists, feeling a slight softness upon impact. The punching bag will sway slightly in response to the force of the punches, providing feedback that reinforces the action. Users may also use their palms or forearms for a more sustained contact, allowing them to blow off steam effectively."
